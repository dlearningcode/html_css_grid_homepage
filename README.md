# README

This webpage was completed as a portfolio project for the Meta Front End Developer Certificate program, course 4: HTML and CSS in Depth. I built it from scratch using CSS grid, and image assets generated by Microsoft Bing.

Initially I used a combination of Grid and Flexbox because I was more familiar with Flexbox, but I went back in and redesigned the stylesheet. The hover message in the promo banner is a z-index grid overlaid on the banner image. It was a lot of fun figuring out what Grid properties replaced Flexbox and standard CSS properties.

Very much looking forward to doing this on a full-time basis!
